# üîê SYLO Discord Bot ‚Äì Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** May 23, 2025

This Privacy Policy explains how the SYLO Discord bot ("SYLO", "we", "our", or "the bot") collects, stores, and uses data. By using SYLO, you agree to this policy.

---

## 1. What Data We Collect

SYLO only stores **minimal, non-personal** data required for the bot to function. This includes:

- **Guild data**: Guild ID, channel IDs, role IDs, feature configuration (e.g. modlog channel, sticky messages)
- **Command logs**: User ID, guild ID, and command usage context for moderation commands (e.g., warnings)
- **Sticky messages**: Embed content and configuration
- **Reaction role setups**: Role associations for emoji-based interactions

We **do not** collect:
- Messages from users (DMs or otherwise)
- IP addresses or device data
- Real names, emails, or personally identifiable information

---

## 2. How We Use the Data

The collected data is used strictly to:

- Deliver bot functionality (e.g., storing settings or warnings)
- Ensure proper operation of features like sticky messages or embed builder
- Improve reliability and user experience

No data is ever sold or shared with third parties.

---

## 3. How Data is Stored

- All data is stored **locally** using a **SQLite** database.
- The database is hosted on the server where the bot is deployed.
- Data is not encrypted at rest, but access to the database is limited to the server owner.

---

## 4. Third-Party Services

SYLO interacts with the Discord API to function. You can view Discord‚Äôs own privacy policies here:

- [Discord Terms of Service](https://discord.com/terms)

---

## 5. User Control

Server administrators can:
- Remove the bot at any time to stop all data collection
- Reset configuration using bot commands
- Request data removal by contacting the maintainer

---

## 6. Data Retention

We retain server-specific data for as long as the bot is in your server. If the bot is removed, data may be deleted automatically or during regular cleanup.

You may also request manual data deletion at any time.

---

## 7. Security

While we take steps to protect stored data (like limited server access), no system is 100% secure. Use of the bot is at your own discretion and risk.

---

## 8. Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy over time. Significant changes will be announced on our GitHub or Discord support server. Continued use of the bot implies acceptance of any updates.

## 9. Contact
